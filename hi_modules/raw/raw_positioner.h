/** A helper class for transferring the position data of a scripted interface to C++. 

	The positioning of UI elements is a rather annoying task (aka pixel-pushing). If
	your interface has a static layout (which is still the case for most plugin projects),
	you will have to shovel around the component positions, recompile, see if it matches, etc.

	The interface designer in HISE was made to improve the efficiency for this step: you have a WYSIWYG
	editor where you can select, drag and resize UI elements just like in any other graphic
	design application. However if you are using the raw API to build your final project in
	C++, you won't be able to leverage this tool, or even worse, if you have made a prototype with
	the interface designer, start from scratch or copy / paste all positions manually.

	This is where this helper class comes in. It takes a object that contains the position and hierarchy
	of every component in your scripted interface and applies it to a C++ Component. It assumes the
	same child-component hierarchy and naming.

	You can create such a Data object simply by right clicking an UI component in the Component List of
	the interface designer and choose "Copy C++ position data to clipboard". Then paste the content of
	the clipboard somewhere in your C++ project and call the apply() method in the resize() callback of the
	root component:

	\code
	// This is our main component class
	class MainInterface: public Component
	{
	public:
	    MainInterface()
		{
			// We need to set the root name
		    setName("Root");

			addAndMakeVisible(slider1);

			// The slider needs to have the exact name as in the data object.
			slider1.setName("Slider1");

			addAndMakeVisible(buttonPanel);
			buttonPanel.setName("ButtonPanel");

			// We add the buttons to the invisible component to match the hierarchy (see below).
			buttonPanel.addAndMakeVisible(leftButton);
			leftButton.setName("LeftButton");

			buttonPanel.addAndMakeVisible(leftButton);
			leftButton.setName("LeftButton");
		}

		void resized()
		{
			// This is pasted from the interface designer.
			// Note how the names and hierarchy matches the component's names and hierarchy.
			raw::Positioner positioner({
			 "Root", { 0, 0, 600, 500 },
			 {
			  { "Slider1", { 227, 96, 140, 70 }, {} },
			  {
			   "ButtonPanel", { 100, 200, 400, 60 },
			   {
				{ "LeftButton", { 64, 18, 117, 25 }, {} },
				{ "RightButton", { 240, 18, 117, 25 }, {} }
			   }
			  }
			 }
			});

			// Applies the positions from above.
			positioner.apply(*this);

			// Everything should be found here...
			positioner.printSummary();
		}
	private:

		juce::Slider slider1;
		juce::Component buttonPanel;
		juce::TextButton leftButton;
		juce::TextButton rightButton;
	};
